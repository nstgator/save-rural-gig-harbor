## How to Upload to GitHub

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

#### Step 1: Upload Assets Folder Images
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the `assets` folder (if it doesn't exist, create it)
3. Click **"Add file" > "Upload files"**
4. Drag and drop these 4 files from the `assets` folder:
   - `kgblack-DfErO7-u.png`
   - `Image_2-DgsFasgr.jpg`
   - `plan-DLBhsaTR.jpg`
   - `Image_3-Cw1h-f0q.jpg`
5. Commit with message: "Add missing asset images"

#### Step 2: Upload Root Level Images
1. Go back to your repository root
2. Click **"Add file" > "Upload files"**
3. Drag and drop the remaining image files:
   - `master_plan_diagram.jpeg`
   - `kensington_building_photo.png`
   - `floor_plan_diagram.jpeg`
   - (Optional: also upload the .webp versions for better performance)
4. Commit with message: "Add missing root images"

### Method 2: Git Command Line

```bash
# Navigate to your local repository folder
cd /path/to/your/repository

# Create assets folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p assets

# Copy the assets folder images
cp /path/to/downloaded/assets/* assets/

# Copy the root level images

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add all missing images"

# Push to GitHub

```

## File Locations on GitHub

Your repository should look like this:

## Verification

After uploading, wait 2-3 minutes then check your GitHub Pages site at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

All images should now display correctly!

## Troubleshooting

### If images still don't show:
1. **Check file names** - They must match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. **Wait a few minutes** - GitHub Pages can take time to update
4. **Check file paths** - Make sure assets are in the `assets` folder

### If upload fails:
1. **File size limits** - GitHub has a 100MB file limit (these are all under 500KB)
2. **Repository limits** - Free accounts have 1GB total storage
3. **Network issues** - Try uploading fewer files at once

## File Sizes
- Total package size: ~2.8MB
- Largest file: floor_plan_diagram.webp (453K)
- Smallest file: plan-DLBhsaTR.jpg (92K)

All files are optimized and ready for web use!

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
1. Check that your repository is public
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings > Pages
3. Make sure you're uploading to the correct branch (usually "main")
4. Try uploading one file at a time if bulk upload fails

The website should work perfectly once these images are uploaded!
